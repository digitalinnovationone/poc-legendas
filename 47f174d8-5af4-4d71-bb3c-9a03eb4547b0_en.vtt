00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
Excellent following today here we understand the

2
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.700
object-oriented concepts are so today we

3
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.300
will move to the four main Pillars that

4
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.600
is abstraction encapsulation inheritance and polymorphism

5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.000
ok, we will understand 100% of the world of orienteering

6
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.200
to objects It's because in a moment of 2 hours you'll get

7
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.200
understand the pillars,

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.300
but this here is the base you're going to use is 80% of the details

9
00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.300
many specifics that you're stepping on the little by little

10
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.300
more bigger goal that we can actually absorb

11
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.700
the pillars of then these are the pillars of guidance

12
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.800
the object is in which inheritance station,

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.400
only we will see where they enter at each moment.

14
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.300
Alright, so our challenge here today I'm going to present

15
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.300
the challenge,

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:57.500
OK?

17
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.500
Then I'll show you videos for requirements.

18
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.000
Today we are going to take a representation,

19
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.400
huh?

20
00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.000
It's these game characters,

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.300
huh?

22
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.800
So here in this case I have no game character,

23
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.100
right from Final Fantasy here which is my favorite series

24
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.100
by the way, we have every RPG game here.

25
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.400
What is another hero adventure game,

26
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.400
we always have that hero figure,

27
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.000
huh?

28
00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We have the bus,

29
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
how many life points does it have?

30
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.900
huh?

31
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.800
And the magic points that the doctors put there,

32
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.000
huh?

33
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.800
So you can see here that this is a representation

34
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.200
complex, right, something is not so simple I can

35
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.000
declare a variable ok then before we start

36
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.800
what you need to have installed on your machine.

37
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.700
So you need to have a code editor of your own

38
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.600
it's happy,

39
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.300
you're showing visual Studio get the same

40
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.700
thing will change when it's time to create the project when

41
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.700
you click on New there,

42
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.400
OK?

43
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.900
So it's exactly the same thing you do.

44
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.200
Studio tattoo World because it is lighter here not

45
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.500
I was with Laine, ok?

46
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.800
If you have been using the vs code the same as using.

47
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.300
And you're programmed in C Sharp,

48
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.300
I'll leave that golden tip to make yours easier

49
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.400
life, there are two extensions that add several shortcuts

50
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400
for whom C Sharp programmer here inside the vs code

51
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.300
it's the first Microsoft class that Richard

52
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.900
so there is an extension to Felipe.

53
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.800
I don't know how to install extension,

54
00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.200
you will come here these little squares here will type

55
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.300
here in the search bar,

56
00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.300
scarf is the first one I showed up, so this one

57
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.700
here is the feeling I'm using, it's with someone

58
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.100
ask later and the other is letting ex have your ok

59
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.800
then add several shortcuts present for you,

60
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.200
can of a class with one click on this one will get

61
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.600
the left button.

62
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.100
It will already give you the option to create a base of a class

63
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.700
Are you sure just so we can buy time

64
00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.700
here in time to enter our place code.

65
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.400
Ask in the chat here,

66
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.600
O.

67
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.500
So it means the person came in after you can

68
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.700
give your buddy just say that leaving the expansion is

69
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.800
and last but not least,

70
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.900
huh?

71
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.700
You need to have Microsoft installed in your home,

72
00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.800
I'm basically what makes it run and close in your

73
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.700
fact machine,

74
00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.900
huh?

75
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.300
So the SDK is just that set of libraries

76
00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.100
will run,

77
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.300
huh?

78
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.100
Which is the developer kit basically that this

79
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.200
here what you need to start writing your

80
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.900
cut lines.
